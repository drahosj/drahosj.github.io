-------------------------

At DEFCON I passed the general-level amateur radio exam, and after having some fun
on HF at ARRL Field Day in Omaha, I was pretty determined to get my own HF rig.
The plan is to build a portable HF go-box type based around the Yaesu FT-450D. The
go-box will include:

- Rig
- 2x 8Ah SLA batteries
- 13.8V buck-boost regulator
- Battery charger

I already built the antenna a while back. It's a homebrew dipole, with an ugly balun
wound around some 4" PVC.

Anyway, on to the unboxing images!
